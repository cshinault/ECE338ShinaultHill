CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1348] Reset pin /Top_0/reset (associated clock /Top_0/clk) is connected to asynchronous reset source /reset.
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Please add Processor System Reset module to create a reset that is synchronous to the associated clock source /clk_wiz_0/clk_slow.
